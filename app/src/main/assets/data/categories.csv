I’m a little older than most students and when I was young Abba the Swedish <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">pop group</span></strong> were very famous &#8230; I don’t think it was cool to like them even though they had a<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> huge following</span></strong> but I think now people have realised what wonderful songs they wrote &#8230; one <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">piece of music</span></strong> in particular  is called ‘Slipping through my fingers’ &#8230; it wasn’t a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">massive hit</span> </strong>but I love it &#8230; it’s a song for parents and it’s all about how quickly our children grow up &#8230; it’s a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">slow number</span> </strong>and like a lot of their songs it’s a very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">catchy tune</span></strong> &#8230; the two women in Abba had great voices and it’s the kind of music you can also <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sing along to</span></strong> easily &#8230; even if you don’t have a great voice &#8230; I listen to Abba when I feel like a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sing-song</span></strong> &#8230; and I especially like to listen when I’m doing the housework &#8230; it stops me thinking about the hard work &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4><strong>Part 3-style questions</strong></h4> <blockquote><p>Examiner:  Is the Internet a good or bad thing for the music industry?<br /> Thomas: On the one hand it’s good for marketing new <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">musical talent</span></strong> or particular bands but it’s so easy to share and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">download tracks</span></strong> for free I think it is costing the industry a lot of money &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Should music be treated as seriously as subjects like maths or sciences at school?<br /> Carla: I think it should &#8230; I don’t think it should be taught in a boring way &#8230; I mean making children <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">read music</span> </strong>&#8230; but I do think they should be encouraged to play instruments and to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">play things by ear</span></strong> perhaps &#8230; to keep the lessons fun &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Where do people usually enjoy listening to music?<br /> Sally: In lots of ways or places &#8230; as <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">background music</span></strong> when they are doing something else &#8230;

it’s a beautiful place &#8230; it’s not what you would call a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sprawling city</span></strong> &#8230; it’s quite compact really and you could walk across the city in a couple of hours &#8230; but there’s no need to do that as we have a fantastic <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">public transport system</span></strong> so it’s easy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get around</span></strong> &#8230;

there’s the Olympic area and the beaches along the coast &#8230; and dotted around the city are some lovely <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">public spaces</span></strong> &#8230; parks and squares in the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">city centre</span></strong> and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>on the outskirts</strong></span> of Barcelona where people relax with their friends and family &#8230;

and the growth in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">out-of-town supermarkets and retail parks</span></strong> mean lots of town centre shops are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">closing down</span></strong> &#8230; plus a shortage of good quality housing &#8230; I think these are the major challenges &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4>Definitions</h4> <ul> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">boarded up shops</span></em></strong>: shops that are no longer doing business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">chain stores</span></em></strong>: well-known brands with shops in multiple cities</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to close down</span></em></strong>: to stop doing business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashionable boutiques</span></em></strong>: fashionable clothes shops</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get around</span></em></strong>: to travel around</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">high-rise flats</span></em></strong>: multi-story apartments</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">inner-city</span></em></strong>: the central part of a city where people live and where condidions are often poor</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">in the suburbs</span></em></strong>: the outer area of large towns and cities where people live</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">lively bars/restaurants</span></em></strong>: bars or restaurants with a good atmosphere</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">local facilities</span></em></strong>: local buildings or services serving the public</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">multi-story car parks</span></em></strong>: car parks on several floors</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">office block</span></em></strong>: a large building that contains offices</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">out of town shopping centre/retail park</span></em></strong>: large shopping centres outside of the town or city</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">pavement cafe</span></em></strong>: cafes with tables outside on the pavement</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">places of interest</span></em></strong>: buildings that have a particular interest for visitors</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">poor housing</span></em></strong>: housing that is not in good condition</li> <li><em><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">public spaces</span></strong></em>: areas in a town or city that are open to the public</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">public transport system</span></em></strong>:  public vehicles such as buses and trains that operate at regular times on fixed routes</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">residential area</span></em></strong>: an area where people live</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">run down</span></em></strong>: old and of a poor standard</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">shopping centre</span></em></strong>: an area consisting of multiple shops</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">shopping malls</span></em></strong>: large indoor shopping centres</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">sprawling city</span></em></strong>: a city that has grown over time and which covers a wide area</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">tourist attraction</span></em></strong>: a place of interest to tourists</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">traffic congestion</span></em></strong>: heavy traffic making it difficult to move around a town or city</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">upmarket shops</span></em></strong>: expensive fashionable shops</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Next Step?</span> Test yourself on topic vocabulary.

Use the &#8216;Definitions&#8217; section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don&#8217;t understand.</p> <h4>Part 1-style questions</h4> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Do you work or are you a student?<br /> Hati: I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">run my own business</span></strong> actually &#8230; I have an online business selling cosmetics &#8230; I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">set up the business</span></strong> 5 years ago and I’m really enjoying <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">working for myself</span> </strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What is your ideal job?<br /> Kaori: I don’t think I’d enjoy working for a big company &#8230; I think I’d like <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go it alone</span></strong> and be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">self-employed</span></strong> &#8230; I’m not sure what area of business it would be but I think I’d enjoy the process of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">drawing up a business plan</span></strong> and seeing if I could be successful &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Is your town a nice place to live?<br /> Monique: It’s OK &#8230; the main problem we have is our local high street &#8230; it used to be a busy centre but lots of shops have <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">gone bust</span></strong> &#8230; it must be very difficult <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to make a profit</span></strong> when you have huge supermarkets in the area and a lot haven’t been able to survive with such <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cut-throat competition</span></strong> &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4><strong>Part 2-style task</strong></h4> <p>Describe a business you know that you admire. You should say</p> <ul> <li>what this business is</li> <li>what the business sells</li> <li>how long you have known about the business</li> </ul> <p>and say why you like it so much.</p> <blockquote><p>Magda:  Actually I discovered a business very recently that I like so much I’d like to do something similar in the future &#8230; it’s a small <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">niche business</span></strong> that runs courses in how to cook &#8230; especially bread &#8230; the owner uses his kitchen for the courses and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">went into business with</span></strong> a local community shop and sells a lot of the bread and cakes they make in the shop &#8230; I first got to hear about the business last year &#8230; my wife paid for me to do one of the baking courses and I got to know the owner during the training &#8230; it’s a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">lifestyle business</span></strong> really &#8230; he doesn’t have plans <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to take on employees</span></strong> or expand into new areas &#8230; he’s happy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">earning a living</span></strong> doing the thing he loves &#8230; I really admire what he does and I’m sure a lot of people would love to do something similar &#8230; he <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">has a web presence</span> </strong>&#8230; in fact that’s how we got to find out about his company &#8230; and he uses social media <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to raise the company profile</span></strong> &#8230; but he’s the only person involved in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">running the business</span></strong> so he’s in complete control of where the business goes &#8230; that’s something that must make it really satisfying &#8230; as long as he’s managing <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to balance the books</span></strong> and the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cash flow</span></strong> is healthy I’m sure he must be very pleased with what he has achieved &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4><strong>Part 3-style questions</strong></h4> <blockquote><p>Examiner:  Why do some people decide to set up their own business?<br /> Marion: I suppose it’s the idea of being in control of your own destiny &#8230; or of believing in a product or service idea you may have &#8230; plus it must be very exciting &#8230;<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> launching products</span></strong> &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">winning contracts</span></strong> &#8230; and seeing your <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sales figures</span></strong> improving must be wonderful &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What are some of the dangers involved in starting a business?<br /> Hiro: Well &#8230; obviously you need to have a good idea &#8230; some people say you need to <strong>do</strong>  <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">market research</span></strong> beforehand so you know what the market wants &#8230; if you don’t do this you could <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">go under</span></strong> &#8230; and if it is a good idea the chances are someone else is doing the same thing so you could end up facing <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">stiff competition</span></strong> &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What are some of things you have to do when running your own business that might not appeal to everyone?<br /> Katy: Personally i don’t like being in debt so <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">taking out a business loan</span></strong> wouldn&#8217;t  suit me at all &#8230; and I know a lot of companies do <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cold calling</span></strong> to try and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">drum up business</span></strong> &#8230; that’s something I’d hate to do &#8230; and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">laying people off</span> </strong>if the business gets into trouble &#8230; that would be horrible &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4>Definitions</h4> <ul> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to balance the books</span></em></strong>: to not spend more money than you are earning</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to be self-employed</span></em></strong>: to work for yourself/to not work for an employer</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to cold call</span></em></strong>: to make a sales call to someone without asking them for permission first</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">cut throat competition</span></em></strong>: when one company lowers its prices, forcing other companies to do the same, sometimes to a point where business becomes unprofitable</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to do market research</span></em></strong>: to do research into what potential customers would or wouldn&#8217;t buy</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to draw up a business plan</span></em></strong>: to write a plan for a new business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to drum up business</span></em></strong>: to try to get customers</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to earn a living</span></em></strong>: to earn money</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go bust</span></em></strong>: when a business is forced to close because it is unsuccessful</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">cash flow</span></em></strong>: the money coming in and going out of a business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go into business with</span></em></strong>: to join another person to start or expand a business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go it alone</span></em></strong>: to start your own business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go under</span></em></strong>: (see &#8216;to go bust&#8217;)</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to have a web presence</span></em></strong>: to have a website or social  media profile that showcases your business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to launch a product</span></em></strong>: to start selling and promoting a new product</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to lay someone off</span></em></strong>: when a company ends an employee&#8217;s contract of employment</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">lifestyle business</span></em></strong>: a business that is set up to bring in a sufficient income and no more</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to make a profit</span></em></strong>: to earn more money than it costs to run the business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">niche business</span></em></strong>: a business that serves a small, particular market</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to raise a company profile</span></em></strong>: to make more people aware of a business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to run your own business</span></em></strong>: to have a business of your own</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">sales figures</span></em></strong>: a report of the income a company generates through sales of products or services</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to set up a business</span></em></strong>: to start a business</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">stiff competition</span></em></strong>: strong competition from other companies in the same area of work</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to take on employees</span></em></strong>: to employ people</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to take out a loan</span></em></strong>: to borrow money</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to win a contract</span></em></strong>: when a business gets legally-binding work with an individual or company</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to work for yourself</span></em></strong>: (see &#8216;to be self-employed&#8217;)</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Next Step?</span> Test yourself on topic vocabulary.

who don’t let people or problems affect them too much &#8230; and if you are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fair-minded</span></strong> you&#8217; ll be less likely to overreact to situations or be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">quick-tempered</span></strong> &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4>Definitions</h4> <ul> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to be the life and soul of the party</span></em></strong>: a fun person, someone who is the centre of activity</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to bend over backwards</span></em></strong>: to try very hard to help someone</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">broad-minded</span></em></strong>: prepared to accept other views or behaviours</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">easy-going</span></em></strong>: relaxed and not easily worried about anything</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">extrovert</span></em></strong>: an energetic person who likes the company of others</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fair-minded</span></em></strong>: to treat people equally</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fun-loving</span></em></strong>: to enjoy having fun</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to hide one’s light under a bushel</span></em></strong>: to hide one&#8217;s talents and skills</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">good company</span></em></strong>: enjoyable to socialise with</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">good sense of humour</span></em></strong>: the ability to understand what is funny</li> <li><strong><em>introvert</em></strong>: someone who is shy</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">laid-back</span></em></strong>: see &#8216;easy-going&#8217;</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to lose one’s temper</span></em></strong>: to suddenly become angry</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">narrow minded</span></em></strong>: opposite of &#8216;broad-minded&#8217;

You should say</p> <ul> <li>who they are</li> <li>how you know them</li> <li>what kind of clothes they wear</li> </ul> <p>and say why you like the way they dress.</p> <blockquote><p>Tomoko:  I’d like to talk about one of my teachers &#8230; Miss Evans &#8230; she teaches us English in the school I go to &#8230; we always look forward to seeing what she’s going to wear when our lessons start &#8230; she’s always very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">well dressed</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">takes a lot of pride in her appearance</span></strong> &#8230; it’s not that she dresses in very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">smart clothes</span></strong> &#8230; she doesn’t come to school <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">dressed to kill</span></strong> or anything like that &#8230; but what she wears really <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">suits her</span></strong> &#8230; and she has a great <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sense of style</span></strong> as well &#8230; we often ask her where she gets some of her clothes and most of the time they’re just <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">off the peg</span></strong> &#8230; and she says she’s not interested in <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>designer labels</strong></span> or anything like that &#8230; she doesn’t seem too concerned about <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">keeping up with the latest fashion</span></strong> &#8230; she just wears clothes that are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">timeless</span></strong> &#8230; yes &#8230; Miss Evans is the person I think looks great in the clothes she wears &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4><strong>Part 3-style questions</strong></h4> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What factors do you think affect the clothes we choose to wear?<br /> Maki: It depends &#8230; where we are or where we&#8217;re going is a big factor &#8230; if you are going out to a club or party you’re going <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to dress for the occasion</span></strong> &#8230; and then there are those who think it’s important to look like they’re <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">on trend</span></strong> &#8230; they’ll want to wear the latest fashions &#8230; there are lots of factors really &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What kind of things determine what is in fashion and what we should be wearing?<br /> Martin: I suppose the big <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion houses</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion shows</span></strong> must have an effect but the clothes you see <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">on the catwalk</span></strong> don’t always reflect what normal people wear &#8230; so I suppose it will be things like what singers are wearing in videos or models are wearing in magazines &#8230; that kind of thing &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Is it possible to look good without spending lots of money on clothes?<br /> Corinna: I’m sure it is &#8230; yes &#8230; I suppose it’s about <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">having an eye for</span></strong> what looks good &#8230; knowing how <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to mix and match</span></strong> different items of clothing that go well together &#8230; I think you can pick up great bargains in charity shops &#8230; sometimes for youngsters even <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">hand-me-downs</span></strong> can look good &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4>Definitions</h4> <ul> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to be on trend</span></em></strong>: to be very fashionable</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">casual clothes</span></em></strong>: not formal</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">classic style</span></em></strong>: a simple, traditional style that is always fashionable</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">designer label</span></em></strong>: a well-known company that makes (often expensive) clothing</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">dressed to kill</span></em></strong>: wearing clothes that attract admirers</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to dress for the occasion</span></em></strong>: to wear clothes suitable for a particular event</li> <li><em><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashionable</span></strong></em>: in fashion</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion house</span></em></strong>: a company that sells (usually expensive) new styles in clothes</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion icon</span></em></strong>: a person who is famous for their sense of fashion</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion show</span></em></strong>: an event where modals show off the latest in fashion designs</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get dressed up</span></em></strong>: to put on nice clothes, often to go out somewhere special</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go out of fashion</span></em></strong>: to not be in fashion any more</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">hand-me-downs</span></em></strong>: clothes that are passed down from older brothers or sisters to their younger siblings</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to have an eye for (fashion)</span></em></strong>: to be a good judge of</li> <li><em><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to have a sense of style</span></strong></em>: the ability to wear clothes that look stylish</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">the height of fashion</span></em></strong>: very fashionable</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to keep up with the latest fashion</span></em></strong>: to wear the latest fashions</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to look good in</span></em></strong>: to wear something that suits you</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to mix and match</span></em></strong>: to wear different styles or items of clothing that aren&#8217;t part of a set outfit</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">must-have</span></em></strong>: something that is highly fashionable and therefore in demand</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">off the peg</span></em></strong>: clothing that is ready made</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">old fashioned</span></em></strong>: not in fashion any more</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">on the catwalk</span></em></strong>: the stage that modals walk along to show off the latest fashions</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">a slave to fashion</span></em></strong>: someone who always feel the need to wear the latest fashions</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">smart clothes</span></em></strong>: the kind of clothes worn for a formal event</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to suit someone</span></em></strong>: to look good on someone</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to take pride in one’s appearance</span></em></strong>: to pay attention to how one looks</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">timeless</span></em></strong>: something that doesn&#8217;t go out of fashion</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">vintage clothes</span></em></strong>: clothes from an earlier period</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">well-dressed</span></em></strong>: to be dressed attractively</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Next Step?</span> Test yourself on topic vocabulary.

You should say</p> <ul> <li>what kind of accommodation it would be</li> <li>where it would be</li> <li>who would live there with you</li> </ul> <p>and say why you would enjoy living in this place.</p> <blockquote><p>Paolo:  I think most people when answering this question would say they’d like to live in a big <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">detached house</span></strong> with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">spacious rooms</span></strong> &#8230; views of the countryside and so on &#8230; but actually my <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">ideal home</span></strong> would be a lot different &#8230; I’ve always loved the idea of having a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">mobile home</span></strong> &#8230; a really expensive one with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">all the mod cons</span></strong> &#8230; so I could live wherever I wanted or at least have lots of holidays and be able to take all my <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">home comforts</span></strong> with me whenever I travelled &#8230; I realise this would have to be a second home as I’d need a base &#8230; a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">permanent address</span></strong> &#8230; but the mobile home would be the accommodation I’d find it exciting to live in &#8230; I suppose once I settle down and have children I&#8217;ll want <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get on the property ladder</span></strong> &#8230; I’ll be like everyone else &#8230; saving up <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to put down a deposit</span></strong> on a house or an apartment &#8230; I don&#8217;t think my family would want to live in a mobile home &#8230; but I like to think I’ll still keep that <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">dream home</span></strong> in mind &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4><strong>Part 3-style questions</strong></h4> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Is it better to own your own home or to rent?<br /> Ana: I think both have their advantages &#8230; living in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">rented accommodation</span></strong> isn’t necessarily a bad thing &#8230; you don’t have a huge debt like you do when you <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">take out a mortgage</span></strong> but I suppose the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">property market</span></strong> offers you an investment for the future &#8230; I’m sure that’s why most people prefer <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to own their own home</span> </strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What options are available to young couples looking for accommodation in your country?<br /> Toni: If they want to buy their own home it isn’t easy for <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">first-time buyers</span></strong> &#8230; mortgages are hard to get so most people live with their parents or in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">rented accommodation</span></strong> &#8230; but that can also be very expensive &#8230; you often have to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">pay rent in advance</span></strong> &#8230; and if the accommodation isn’t <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fully furnished</span> </strong>you have the expense of buying furniture &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: What are some of the pleasures involved in making a home for ourselves?<br /> Suki: I suppose it starts with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">house-hunting</span></strong> &#8230; finding your ideal home &#8230; some people enjoy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">doing up an old property</span></strong> &#8230; giving a property that&#8217;s old and tired a new lease of life &#8230; others like making wherever they live feel like home with some <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">home comforts</span></strong> &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4>Definitions</h4> <ul> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">(all the) mod cons</span></em></strong>: technology at home that makes jobs easier such as a washing machine, dishwasher etc.</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">apartment block</span></em></strong>: a large building made up of smaller units of apartments</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">back garden</span></em></strong>: a garden at the rear of the house</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">detached house</span></em></strong>: a house that is not physically connected to another property</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to do up a property</span></em></strong>: to repair an old building</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">dream home</span></em></strong>: a home you regard as perfect</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">first-time buyer</span></em></strong>: someone buying a property for the first time, especially when taking out a loan (mortgage)</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">fully-furnished</span></em></strong>: a rented property with all furniture included</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get on the property ladder</span></em></strong>: to buy a property with the aim of buying another bigger or more expensive one later in life</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">hall of residence</span></em></strong>: a college or university building where students live</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">home comforts</span></em></strong>: things that make a home feel comfortable to live in</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">house-hunting</span></em></strong>: looking for a property to live in</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">house-warming party</span></em></strong>: a party to celebrate moving into a new home</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">ideal home</span></em></strong>: a perfect home</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to live on campus</span></em></strong>: to live on the university or college grounds</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">mobile home</span></em></strong>: a home that can be moved by a vehicle or one that has its own engine</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to move into</span></em></strong>: to begin to live in a property</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to own your own home</span></em></strong>: to have bought the property you live in</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to pay rent in advance</span></em></strong>: weekly or monthly rent paid at the beginning of the week or month</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">permanent address</span></em></strong>: a fixed address</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">property market</span></em></strong>: the buying and selling of land or buildings</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to put down a deposit</span></em></strong>: to pay an amount of money as the first in a series of future payments</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">rented accommodation</span></em></strong>: property owned by someone else and for which a person pays a fixed amount to live in</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">single room</span></em></strong>: a room for one person</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">spacious room</span></em></strong>: a large room</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">student digs</span></em></strong>: student accommodation</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">the suburbs</span></em></strong>: a residential area on the edge of towns or cities</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">to take out a mortgage</span></em></strong>: to borrow a large amount of money, paid back over several years, in order to buy a house</li> <li><strong><em><span style=""color: #000000;"">terraced house</span></em></strong>: a house connected on both sides by other properties</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Next Step?</span> Test yourself on topic vocabulary.

You should say:</p> <ul> <li>what this place is</li> <li>when you go there</li> <li>what you do there</li> </ul> <p>and say why you enjoy it there so much.</p> <blockquote><p>Maurice:  I&#8217;d like to talk about my local <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sports centre</strong></span> &#8230; it&#8217;s a place I spend a lot of time in  &#8230; it&#8217;s a new building with all the latest <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sports facilities</strong> </span>&#8230; I probably go there at least twice a week &#8230; sometimes more often &#8230; it&#8217;s a huge place &#8230; there&#8217;s an outdoor <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>athletics track</strong> </span>and some <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>football pitches</strong></span> &#8230; I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>play football</strong></span> so I&#8217;m often out there &#8230; there are several indoor <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>squash and tennis courts</strong></span> that I use occasionally &#8230; a big <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>swimming pool</strong> </span>&#8230; although I don&#8217;t use that very often &#8230; I&#8217;m not a very <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>strong swimmer</strong></span> &#8230; there&#8217;s a gym &#8230; lots of things really &#8230; why do I enjoy going there &#8230; it&#8217;s just a really fun place to be &#8230; there&#8217;s a good social side to it all &#8230; you can enter competitions &#8230; meet up with other people who want to do the same sports &#8230; and because there are so many activities on offer it gets you interested in different things &#8230; for example I was listening to some people talking about training <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to run the marathon</strong></span> and I&#8217;ve decided I might even think about that &#8230; I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>go jogging</strong></span> a couple of times a week so it would give me something to aim for &#8230; so yes &#8230; the sports centre &#8230; that&#8217;s the place I really like to visit &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4><strong>Part 3-style questions</strong></h4> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Should people be encouraged more to take up sport?<br /> Alejandro: I think young people should be given the chance to discover which sport they might like &#8230; watching sport is sometimes a good way to get people started &#8230; not on TV but actually getting out &#8230; take athletics for example &#8230; they could go to <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>an athletics meeting</strong></span> &#8230; there are so many different sports on show one might interest them &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Why do some people enjoy participating in sport more than others?<br /> Florrie: That&#8217;s a good question &#8230; I suppose some people are more concerned about their health &#8230; they can&#8217;t stand the thought of <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>being out of condition</strong></span> &#8230; other people might be driven to excel &#8230; they want <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to set records</strong></span> or get <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>personal bests</strong></span> &#8230;</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Examiner: Which sports do you think are best for people who aren&#8217;t used to physical activity?<br /> Julie: Well &#8230; I think people like this should avoid <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>strenuous exercise</strong></span> so things like <strong>circuit training</strong> are definitely out of the question &#8230; maybe just doing <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a brisk walk</strong></span> every day &#8230; or swimming is always a good way to get started &#8230;</p></blockquote> <h4>Definitions</h4> <ul> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><em>an athletics meeting</em></strong></span>: an event where various athletics sports are held</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>an athletics track</strong></em></span>: a running track</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>an away game</strong></em></span>: a football match played in the opposing teams stadium</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a brisk walk</strong></em></span>: a fast walk</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to do judo</strong></em></span>: (not go or play)</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a football fan</strong></em></span>: someone who likes football</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a fitness programme</strong></em></span>: a schedule of activities to keep fit</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a football match</strong></em></span>: a game of football</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a football pitch</strong></em></span>: the surface on which you play football (as opposed to a stadium, which is the building)</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a football season</strong></em></span>: a period in the year when football is played</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to get into shape</strong></em></span>: to become fit</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to go jogging</strong></em></span>: to run around the streets</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a home game</strong></em></span>:  a football match played in the teams own stadium</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to keep fit</strong></em></span>: to stay in good physically condition</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to be out of condition</strong></em></span>: to not be physically fit</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a personal best</strong></em></span>: to achieve the best personal result so far in a sport</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a personal trainer</strong></em></span>: a sports coach that helps you on a one-to-one basis</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to play tennis/football</strong></em></span>: (not do or go)</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to run the marathon</strong></em></span>: to run a distance of 42.195 Kilometres</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a season ticket</strong></em></span>: a ticket that gives you entry to most of a team’s home games during the sporting year.</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to set a record</strong></em></span>: to achieve the best result in a sport</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a sports centre</strong></em></span>: a public building where people can do various sports</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>sports facilities</strong></em></span>: the equipment and services needed to do a sport</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a squash/tennis/badminton court</strong></em></span>: the surface where you play these sports</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>strenuous exercise</strong></em></span>: exercise that needs a lot of physical effort</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a strong swimmer</strong></em></span>: a good swimmer</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>a swimming pool</strong></em></span>: the place where you swim</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to take up exercise</strong></em></span>: to start doing exercise</li> <li><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>to train hard</strong></em></span>: to train with a lot of effort</li> </ul> <h4>Next Step?</h4> <p>Test yourself on topic vocabulary to talk about sport.

how to use email &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">send attachments</span></strong> how to <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>access websites</strong></span> &#8230; then I decided to do a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">digital editing</span></strong> course for video and photography &#8230; and so I bought the laptop when I started the course  &#8230;  my husband had a <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>desktop PC</strong></span> but it was very slow so I decided <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to upgrade</strong></span> to a powerful one because we do a lot of video editing on the course &#8230; it&#8217;s a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">high-spec</span></strong> laptop &#8230; very fast &#8230; the latest <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>operating system</strong></span> &#8230;

if I didn&#8217;t have it I daresay I&#8217;d have to spend more time at college using their computers &#8230; but on the positive side I suppose I&#8217;d read a lot more if I didn&#8217;t have it  &#8230;
