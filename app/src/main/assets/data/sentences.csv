1;"<p>Examiner: What kind of music do you listen to?<br /> Katherine: I’m a big fan of <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>classical music</strong></span> &#8230; it doesn’t make me very popular with my children &#8230; their <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">taste in music</span></strong> is completely different &#8230; they always want to listen to their favourite <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">rock bands</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
2;"<p>Examiner: Do you play any instruments?<br /> Jamie: No I don’t &#8230; I’ve always wished I’d <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">taken up a musical instrument</span> </strong>&#8230; I’d love to be able to play the guitar &#8230; but I think I’m a bit <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>tone deaf</strong></span> so perhaps I’d find it hard &#8230;</p>"
3;"<p>Examiner: Have you got any hobbies or interests?<br /> Marco: I’m really into<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> live music</span></strong> &#8230; I go to a lot of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">music festivals</span></strong> &#8230; I think a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">live performance</span></strong> always sounds more exciting than a recorded version &#8230; as long as the performers can sing and play well of course &#8230;</p>"
4;"<p>Examiner:&nbsp;Examiner:&nbsp;What kind of music do you listen to?<br />

Millie: &nbsp;Well &hellip; I&rsquo;m a little older than most students and when I was young Abba the Swedish <strong><span>pop group</span></strong> were very famous &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think it was cool to like them even though they had a<strong><span> huge following</span></strong> but I think now people have realised what wonderful songs they wrote &hellip; one <strong><span>piece of music</span></strong> in particular &nbsp;is called &lsquo;Slipping through my fingers&rsquo; &hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t a <strong><span>massive hit</span> </strong>but I love it &hellip; it&rsquo;s a song for parents and it&rsquo;s all about how quickly our children grow up &hellip; it&rsquo;s a <strong><span>slow number</span> </strong>and like a lot of their songs it&rsquo;s a very <strong><span>catchy tune</span></strong> &hellip; the two women in Abba <strong>had great voices</strong> and it&rsquo;s the kind of music you can also <strong><span>sing along to</span></strong> easily &hellip; even if you don&rsquo;t have a great voice &hellip; I listen to Abba when I feel like a <strong><span>sing-song</span></strong> &hellip; and I especially like to listen when I&rsquo;m doing the housework &hellip; it stops me thinking about the hard work &hellip;</p>



<p><em>For this kind of question, you should say</em></p>



<ul>

 <li><em>what the piece of music is called</em></li>

 <li><em>how long you have liked it</em></li>

 <li><em>when you like to listen to it</em></li>

</ul>



<p><em>and say why you like it so much.</em></p>

5;"<p>Examiner:  Is the Internet a good or bad thing for the music industry?<br /> Thomas: On the one hand it’s good for marketing new <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">musical talent</span></strong> or particular bands but it’s so easy to share and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">download tracks</span></strong> for free I think it is costing the industry a lot of money &#8230;</p>"
6;"<p>Examiner: Should music be treated as seriously as subjects like maths or sciences at school?<br /> Carla: I think it should &#8230; I don’t think it should be taught in a boring way &#8230; I mean making children <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">read music</span> </strong>&#8230; but I do think they should be encouraged to play instruments and to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">play things by ear</span></strong> perhaps &#8230; to keep the lessons fun &#8230;</p>"
7;"<p>Examiner: Where do people usually enjoy listening to music?<br /> Sally: In lots of ways or places &#8230; as <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">background music</span></strong> when they are doing something else &#8230; at concerts when a band <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">goes on tour</span></strong> &#8230; or in clubs or discos &#8230;</p>"
8;"<p>Examiner: What is it like where you live?<br /> Christiane: I live in a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">residential area</span></strong> of a busy town in the south of Spain &#8230; we have all the facilities you need &#8230; good <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">public transport</span></strong> &#8230; a good <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">shopping centre</span></strong> &#8230; it’s nice &#8230;</p>"
9;"<p>Examiner: Do you like living in the city?<br /> Andrea: Yes I do &#8230; I like going out with my friends and there are lots of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">lively bars and restaurants</span></strong> within walking distance of my apartment &#8230; I’m a bit of a culture vulture as well so it’s great to have access to art exhibitions and that kind of thing &#8230;</p>"
10;"<p>Examiner: Do you get many tourists visiting your area?<br /> Mandy: Not really no &#8230; I live in the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">inner-city</span></strong> and the area is a little <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">run down</span></strong> &#8230; it’s basically a lot of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">high-rise flats</span></strong> and many of the shops are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">boarded up</span></strong> &#8230; so nothing to interest tourists really &#8230;</p>"
11;"<p>Monique:  Anyone who comes to my country really should spend some time in Barcelona &#8230; it’s a beautiful place &#8230; it’s not what you would call a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sprawling city</span></strong> &#8230; it’s quite compact really and you could walk across the city in a couple of hours &#8230; but there’s no need to do that as we have a fantastic <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">public transport system</span></strong> so it’s easy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get around</span></strong> &#8230; there are various districts all with their own character &#8230; you have the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">upmarket shops</span></strong> in the centre &#8230; you’ll find lots of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">chain stores</span></strong> you’ll recognise from your own country but also local brands as well &#8230; we have the narrow streets in the Gothic district with lots of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashionable boutiques</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">tourist attractions</span></strong> &#8230; there’s the Olympic area and the beaches along the coast &#8230; and dotted around the city are some lovely <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">public spaces</span></strong> &#8230; parks and squares in the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">city centre</span></strong> and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>on the outskirts</strong></span> of Barcelona where people relax with their friends and family &#8230; and of course <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">pavement cafes</span></strong> everywhere &#8230; all that and some great historical <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">places of interest</span> </strong>&#8230; so a great destination for tourists &#8230;</p>"
12;"<p>Examiner: &nbsp;What are the advantages of living in a city or big town?<br />

 Carrie:&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s having access to <strong>local facilities</strong> really &hellip; local shops as well as access to larger <span ><strong>shopping malls</strong></span> in the city centre &hellip; and if you&rsquo;re well-off you can afford to live <strong><span >in the suburbs</span></strong> away from the busy traffic&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

"
13;"<p>Examiner: In your experience are city centres usually attractive places?<br /> Mary: Some can be yes &#8230; especially those with a historical interest &#8230; but sometimes they’re full of ugly <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">office blocks</span></strong> &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">multi-story car parks</span></strong> &#8230; and residents living in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">poor housing</span></strong> &#8230; it depends on the city doesn’t it?</p>"
14;"<p>Examiner: What are some of the challenges facing towns and cities?<br /> Penny: I suppose<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong> traffic congestion</strong></span> is a major problem &#8230; and the growth in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">out-of-town supermarkets and retail parks</span></strong> mean lots of town centre shops are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">closing down</span></strong> &#8230; plus a shortage of good quality housing &#8230; I think these are the major challenges &#8230;</p>"
15;"<p>Examiner: Do you look like any other people in your family?<br /> Carlo: No &#8230; not at all &#8230; take my brother for example &#8230; he has short <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cropped hair</span></strong> and has quite a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">pointed face</span></strong> &#8230; he’s also quite <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>fair-skinned</strong></span> compared to me &#8230;</p>"
16;"<p>Examiner: Tell me about your family.<br /> Andrea: My father’<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">s getting on a bit</span></strong> &#8230; he’s <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">in his 60s</span></strong> &#8230; but he <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">looks very young for his age</span></strong> &#8230; he still does lots of exercise and is quite <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">well-built</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
17;"<p>Examiner: What does your best friend look like?<br /> Mandy: She’s the same age as me &#8230; she has <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">shoulder-length hair</span></strong> &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fair hair</span> </strong>&#8230; she has a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">slim figure</span></strong> and is <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">medium height</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
18;"<p>Monique:  OK &#8230; I’d like to talk about my aunt &#8230; her name’s Marta and she’s quite a character &#8230; she’<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">s</span> <span style=""color: #000000;"">middle-aged</span></strong> but has a very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">youthful appearance</span></strong> &#8230; she’s a little <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">overweight</span></strong> I suppose but not too much &#8230; she has a friendly <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">round face</span></strong> framed by <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">thick blonde hair</span></strong> &#8230; she has a lovely <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">complexion</span></strong> and she’s always <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">well-turned out</span></strong> &#8230; she actually always looks like she’s going out for the evening to somewhere special &#8230; there’<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>s never a hair out of place</strong></span> &#8230; I’ve always thought she <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">bears a striking resemblance to</span></strong> someone on TV &#8230; I can’t remember the name now &#8230; she <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">wears glasses</span></strong> and always seems to have a different pair on every time I see her &#8230; I like the way she looks because she wears clothes that are right for her age and manages to look glamorous without it looking like she’s too done up &#8230; yes &#8230; I’ll be happy if I look like her when I’m her age &#8230;</p>"
19;"<p>Examiner:  Is it important to dress well whenever we go out?<br /> Mark: It depends where you’re going &#8230; I know some people <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>get done up</strong></span> just to go to the shops &#8230; but I don’t see the point &#8230; you shouldn&#8217;t go out looking <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">scruffy</span></strong> with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">disheveled hair</span></strong> but I really don’t see the point in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">getting dressed up to the nines</span></strong> unless you’re going somewhere special &#8230;</p>"
20;"<p>Examiner: Do people worry too much about their appearance as they get older?<br /> Mira: I’m sure they do &#8230; yes &#8230; but it happens to all of us doesn’t it &#8230; we all <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">go grey</span></strong> eventually and get <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">hard of hearing</span></strong> &#8230; we start <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to lose our figure</span></strong> &#8230; that’s why plastic surgery is so popular &#8230; personally I think we just need <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to grow old gracefully</span></strong> and not worry too much about how we look &#8230;</p>"
21;"<p>Examiner: Is attractiveness a quality worthwhile aiming for?<br /> Phoebe: I&#8217;d like to say no &#8230; it shouldn&#8217;t matter what we look like in terms of our physical appearance &#8230; but unfortunately it seems women especially are taken more seriously if they are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">good looking</span></strong> with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a slender figure</span></strong> with perfect <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">make up</span></strong> and so on &#8230;</p>"
22;"<p>Examiner: Do you work or are you a student?<br /> Hati: I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">run my own business</span></strong> actually &#8230; I have an online business selling cosmetics &#8230; I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">set up the business</span></strong> 5 years ago and I’m really enjoying <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">working for myself</span> </strong>&#8230;</p>"
23;"<p>Examiner: What is your ideal job?<br /> Kaori: I don’t think I’d enjoy working for a big company &#8230; I think I’d like <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to go it alone</span></strong> and be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">self-employed</span></strong> &#8230; I’m not sure what area of business it would be but I think I’d enjoy the process of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">drawing up a business plan</span></strong> and seeing if I could be successful &#8230;</p>"
24;"<p>Examiner: Is your town a nice place to live?<br /> Monique: It’s OK &#8230; the main problem we have is our local high street &#8230; it used to be a busy centre but lots of shops have <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">gone bust</span></strong> &#8230; it must be very difficult <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to make a profit</span></strong> when you have huge supermarkets in the area and a lot haven’t been able to survive with such <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cut-throat competition</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
25;"<p>Magda:  Actually I discovered a business very recently that I like so much I’d like to do something similar in the future &#8230; it’s a small <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">niche business</span></strong> that runs courses in how to cook &#8230; especially bread &#8230; the owner uses his kitchen for the courses and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">went into business with</span></strong> a local community shop and sells a lot of the bread and cakes they make in the shop &#8230; I first got to hear about the business last year &#8230; my wife paid for me to do one of the baking courses and I got to know the owner during the training &#8230; it’s a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">lifestyle business</span></strong> really &#8230; he doesn’t have plans <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to take on employees</span></strong> or expand into new areas &#8230; he’s happy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">earning a living</span></strong> doing the thing he loves &#8230; I really admire what he does and I’m sure a lot of people would love to do something similar &#8230; he <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">has a web presence</span> </strong>&#8230; in fact that’s how we got to find out about his company &#8230; and he uses social media <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to raise the company profile</span></strong> &#8230; but he’s the only person involved in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">running the business</span></strong> so he’s in complete control of where the business goes &#8230; that’s something that must make it really satisfying &#8230; as long as he’s managing <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to balance the books</span></strong> and the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cash flow</span></strong> is healthy I’m sure he must be very pleased with what he has achieved &#8230;</p>"
26;"<p>Examiner:  Why do some people decide to set up their own business?<br /> Marion: I suppose it’s the idea of being in control of your own destiny &#8230; or of believing in a product or service idea you may have &#8230; plus it must be very exciting &#8230;<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> launching products</span></strong> &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">winning contracts</span></strong> &#8230; and seeing your <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sales figures</span></strong> improving must be wonderful &#8230;</p>"
27;"<p>Examiner:&nbsp;What are some of the dangers involved in starting a business?<br />

 Hiro:&nbsp;Well &hellip; obviously you need to have a good idea &hellip; some people say you need to <strong>do market research</strong> beforehand so you know what the market wants &hellip; if you don&rsquo;t do this you could <strong><span >go under</span></strong> &hellip; and if it is a good idea the chances are someone else is doing the same thing so you could end up facing <strong><span >stiff competition</span></strong> &hellip;</p>

"
28;"<p>Examiner: What are some of things you have to do when running your own business that might not appeal to everyone?<br /> Katy: Personally i don’t like being in debt so <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">taking out a business loan</span></strong> wouldn&#8217;t  suit me at all &#8230; and I know a lot of companies do <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cold calling</span></strong> to try and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">drum up business</span></strong> &#8230; that’s something I’d hate to do &#8230; and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">laying people off</span> </strong>if the business gets into trouble &#8230; that would be horrible &#8230;</p>"
29;"<p>Examiner: How would you describe yourself?<br /> Paula: Everyone tells me I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">take after</span></strong> my mum as I’m quite <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">laid-back</span></strong> &#8230; I think I’m <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">good company</span></strong> but you should ask my friends if they agree &#8230;</p>"
30;"<p>Examiner: In which ways are you similar to your friends?<br /> Manuel: I seem to be attracted to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">introverts</span></strong> &#8230; not people who are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">painfully shy</span> </strong>but most of my friends are a little <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">reserved</span></strong> &#8230; and I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m like &#8230;</p>"
31;"<p>Examiner: Are you similar or different to your brother(s)/sister(s)?<br /> Mira: I think my brother and I are very similar &#8230; I’d say we’re <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fun-loving</span> </strong>and tend to be a bit <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">extroverted</span></strong> &#8230; my brother is certainly <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">the life and soul of the party</span></strong> &#8230; I’m not sure that applies to me &#8230;</p>"
32;"<p>Carolina  &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to describe my English teacher from school &hellip; Miss Thomas &hellip; this was a few years ago now and she was my teacher at a time when I was getting a little bored with being at school &hellip; unlike some of the other teachers Miss Thomas never <strong><span >lost her tempe</span><span >r</span></strong>  hellip; she was very calm and<strong><span > easy-going</span></strong>  hellip; she was also very <strong><span >broad-minded</span></strong>  hellip; we were able to ask her questions about lots of subjects that some other teachers would refuse to discuss which made us respect her even more &hellip; she had a great <strong><span >sense of humour</span></strong> too &hellip; she&rsquo;d laugh at our jokes as well as making us laugh &hellip; and she would also <strong><span >bend over backwards</span></strong> to help us with our work &hellip; she always <strong><span >put us first</span> </strong>and often stayed around at the end of class to talk with anyone who needed help &hellip; apparently she was highly respected within her field but you would never know as she was the type that <strong><span >hide her light under a bushel</span></strong> &hellip; she was very modest and <strong><span >self-effacing</span></strong> &hellip; so yes &hellip; Miss Thomas was a teacher I have fond memories of &hellip;</p>

33;"<p>Examiner:  Which personal qualities do you think we most want to pass on to our children?<br /> Martin: I certainly would want my children to be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">self-confident</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">self-assured</span></strong> &#8230; I really believe that people who feel good about themselves are in a good position to face what life has to offer them &#8230; and I’d hope they wouldn’t be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">self-centred</span></strong> &#8230; but remembered to think about others &#8230;</p>"
34;"<p>Examiner: Which characteristics do you think are the least appealing in a person?<br /> Marianne: Well &#8230; people who are very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">narrow-minded</span></strong> are difficult to get on with &#8230; it&#8217;s nice when someone is open to other people’s opinion and willing to think about their own views &#8230; and people who are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">two-faced</span></strong> can be a little irritating &#8230; relationships are built on trust and without honesty there’s not much left &#8230;</p>"
35;"<p>Examiner: Which personality types do you think are less likely to suffer from stress or anxiety?<br /> Sol: Probably people who are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">thick-skinned</span></strong> &#8230; who don’t let people or problems affect them too much &#8230; and if you are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fair-minded</span></strong> you&#8217; ll be less likely to overreact to situations or be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">quick-tempered</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
36;"<p>Examiner: Do you enjoy buying clothes?<br /> Pedro: I used to &#8230; yes &#8230; like most young people I was a bit of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a slave to fashion</span></strong> and I’d always have to buy that <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">must-have</span></strong> shirt or pair of shoes &#8230; I’m not so bothered now though &#8230; I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing something <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">old fashioned</span> </strong>but I’m not as bothered as I used to be about what I wear &#8230;</p>"
37;"<p>Examiner: What kind of clothes do you like to wear?<br /> Marco: I prefer <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">casual clothes</span></strong> actually &#8230; I hate <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">getting dressed up</span></strong> for special occasions &#8230; personally I think it’s possible <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to look good in</span></strong> a pair of jeans &#8230; but that’s my opinion &#8230; I don’t think my wife would call me a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion icon</span></strong> that’s for sure &#8230;</p>"
38;"<p>Examiner: Are there many clothes shops where you live?<br /> Sylvia: Yes &#8230; there are lots in my town &#8230; apart from the big chain stores we’ve got a couple of really nice shops that sell <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">vintage clothes</span></strong> &#8230; old clothes but in a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">classic style</span></strong> that never really <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">go out of fashion</span></strong> &#8230; I love going there<strong> </strong>&#8230;</p>"
39;"<p>Tomoko:  I’d like to talk about one of my teachers &#8230; Miss Evans &#8230; she teaches us English in the school I go to &#8230; we always look forward to seeing what she’s going to wear when our lessons start &#8230; she’s always very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">well dressed</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">takes a lot of pride in her appearance</span></strong> &#8230; it’s not that she dresses in very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">smart clothes</span></strong> &#8230; she doesn’t come to school <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">dressed to kill</span></strong> or anything like that &#8230; but what she wears really <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">suits her</span></strong> &#8230; and she has a great <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">sense of style</span></strong> as well &#8230; we often ask her where she gets some of her clothes and most of the time they’re just <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">off the peg</span></strong> &#8230; and she says she’s not interested in <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>designer labels</strong></span> or anything like that &#8230; she doesn’t seem too concerned about <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">keeping up with the latest fashion</span></strong> &#8230; she just wears clothes that are <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">timeless</span></strong> &#8230; yes &#8230; Miss Evans is the person I think looks great in the clothes she wears &#8230;</p>"
40;"<p>Examiner: What factors do you think affect the clothes we choose to wear?<br /> Maki: It depends &#8230; where we are or where we&#8217;re going is a big factor &#8230; if you are going out to a club or party you’re going <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to dress for the occasion</span></strong> &#8230; and then there are those who think it’s important to look like they’re <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">on trend</span></strong> &#8230; they’ll want to wear the latest fashions &#8230; there are lots of factors really &#8230;</p>"
41;"<p>Examiner: What kind of things determine what is in fashion and what we should be wearing?<br /> Martin: I suppose the big <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion houses</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fashion shows</span></strong> must have an effect but the clothes you see <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">on the catwalk</span></strong> don’t always reflect what normal people wear &#8230; so I suppose it will be things like what singers are wearing in videos or models are wearing in magazines &#8230; that kind of thing &#8230;</p>"
42;"<p>Examiner: Is it possible to look good without spending lots of money on clothes?<br /> Corinna: I’m sure it is &#8230; yes &#8230; I suppose it’s about <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">having an eye for</span></strong> what looks good &#8230; knowing how <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to mix and match</span></strong> different items of clothing that go well together &#8230; I think you can pick up great bargains in charity shops &#8230; sometimes for youngsters even <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">hand-me-downs</span></strong> can look good &#8230;</p>"
43;"<p>Examiner: Do you live in a house or an apartment?<br /> Callum: Actually I live <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">on campus</span></strong> &#8230; in a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">single room</span></strong> in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">halls of residence</span></strong> &#8230; all first year students are encouraged to do that as they’re close to the university &#8230; next year I plan to move into <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">student digs</span></strong> in town &#8230;</p>"
44;"<p>Examiner: Tell me about where you live.<br /> Julia: I live with my parents <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">in the suburbs</span></strong> of Madrid &#8230; we only <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">moved in</span></strong> recently &#8230; in fact we had a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">house-warming party</span></strong> just a few weeks ago &#8230;</p>"
45;"<p>Examiner: What kind of accommodation do most people live in in your city?<br /> Maria: In the city itself the majority of people live in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">apartment blocks</span></strong> &#8230; that’s what surprised me about England &#8230; most people seem to live in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">terraced houses</span></strong> with lovely <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">back gardens</span> </strong>&#8230;</p>"
46;"<p>Paolo:  I think most people when answering this question would say they’d like to live in a big <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">detached house</span></strong> with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">spacious rooms</span></strong> &#8230; views of the countryside and so on &#8230; but actually my <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">ideal home</span></strong> would be a lot different &#8230; I’ve always loved the idea of having a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">mobile home</span></strong> &#8230; a really expensive one with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">all the mod cons</span></strong> &#8230; so I could live wherever I wanted or at least have lots of holidays and be able to take all my <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">home comforts</span></strong> with me whenever I travelled &#8230; I realise this would have to be a second home as I’d need a base &#8230; a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">permanent address</span></strong> &#8230; but the mobile home would be the accommodation I’d find it exciting to live in &#8230; I suppose once I settle down and have children I&#8217;ll want <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to get on the property ladder</span></strong> &#8230; I’ll be like everyone else &#8230; saving up <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to put down a deposit</span></strong> on a house or an apartment &#8230; I don&#8217;t think my family would want to live in a mobile home &#8230; but I like to think I’ll still keep that <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">dream home</span></strong> in mind &#8230;</p>"
47;"<p>Examiner: Is it better to own your own home or to rent?<br /> Ana: I think both have their advantages &#8230; living in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">rented accommodation</span></strong> isn’t necessarily a bad thing &#8230; you don’t have a huge debt like you do when you <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">take out a mortgage</span></strong> but I suppose the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">property market</span></strong> offers you an investment for the future &#8230; I’m sure that’s why most people prefer <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to own their own home</span> </strong>&#8230;</p>"
48;"<p>Examiner: What options are available to young couples looking for accommodation in your country?<br /> Toni: If they want to buy their own home it isn’t easy for <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">first-time buyers</span></strong> &#8230; mortgages are hard to get so most people live with their parents or in <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">rented accommodation</span></strong> &#8230; but that can also be very expensive &#8230; you often have to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">pay rent in advance</span></strong> &#8230; and if the accommodation isn’t <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">fully furnished</span> </strong>you have the expense of buying furniture &#8230;</p>"
49;"<p>Examiner: What are some of the pleasures involved in making a home for ourselves?<br /> Suki: I suppose it starts with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">house-hunting</span></strong> &#8230; finding your ideal home &#8230; some people enjoy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">doing up an old property</span></strong> &#8230; giving a property that&#8217;s old and tired a new lease of life &#8230; others like making wherever they live feel like home with some <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">home comforts</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
50;"<p>Examiner: Do you like to read books?<br /> Marie: Yes &#8230; I love reading &#8230; I like nothing more than<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong> to be engrossed in</strong></span> a good book &#8230; I regularly <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>take out </strong></span>books from the library and usually read them <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>from cover to cover</strong></span> in no time &#8230; and I can&#8217;t go to sleep at night without some good <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>bedtime reading</strong></span> &#8230;</p>"
51;"<p>Examiner: How often do you go to the cinema?<br /> Jemma: Unfortunately we don&#8217;t have a cinema near us so we have to go into the nearest town <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to catch the latest movie</strong></span> &#8230; I usually avoid seeing popular <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>box-office hits</strong></span> which I&#8217;m not always keen on seeing &#8230; I prefer <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>low-budget films</strong></span> &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sci-fi</strong> </span>especially &#8230; and there&#8217;s a great cinema I go to that has frequent <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">showings</span></strong> of films like these &#8230;</p>"
52;"<p>Examiner: Do you prefer reading books or watching films?<br /> Louisa: I&#8217;m not really <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a big reader</span></strong> &#8230; I find books quite <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">heavy-going</span></strong> &#8230; so I much prefer to see a film &#8230; perhaps it&#8217;s the <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>special effects</strong></span> or the <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>soundtrack</strong></span> &#8230; I don&#8217;t know &#8230; I just prefer a film &#8230;</p>"
53;"<p>Pauline  I like reading &#8230; especially English novels &#8230; it&#8217;s a great way to improve your vocabulary and there are so many fantastic authors to choose from &#8230; one book that <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">came highly recommended</span></strong> by my teacher was The Mayor of Casterbridge &#8230; I was studying at a school in The UK at the time and she said it would give me a picture of what life was like years ago in the area I was living &#8230; well I have to say I absolutely loved it  &#8230; it was <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a real page-turner</span></strong> &#8230; it&#8217;s a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">historical novel</span></strong> and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>the setting</strong></span> was a fictional town called Casterbridge &#8230; but actually it was <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">based on</span></strong> a town near where I was studying called Dorchester &#8230; it had such a great <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">plot</span></strong> &#8230; to cut a long story short <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>it tells the story of</strong> </span>the downfall of a man called Henchard <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">the central character</span></strong> who lives during a period of great social change around the time of the industrial revolution &#8230; the reason I enjoyed it so much &#8230; apart from the great story &#8230; it gave me a picture of what life had been like in the place I was studying at the time &#8230; I really <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">couldn&#8217;t put it down</span></strong> &#8230; a fantastic story &#8230;</p>"
54;"<p>Examiner: Is reading as pleasurable in digital format?<br /> Alise: Personally I prefer reading a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">paperback</span></strong> or <strong>hardback</strong> &#8230; especially if I&#8217;m reading <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a classic</strong></span> which I don&#8217;t think feels right as an <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>e-book</strong></span> &#8230; but I can see it can be good for others &#8230; my grandmother has an <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>e-reader</strong></span> and she loves the way you can enlarge the text &#8230;</p>"
55;"<p>Examiner: Do you think bookshops will survive the digital revolution?<br /> Thomas: I think so &#8230; at least I hope so &#8230; I love <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>flicking through</strong></span> books in a bookshop &#8230; online shopping is useful &#8230; finding out on Amazon if a book you want has <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">got a good review</span></strong> &#8230; maybe getting one that is difficult to find &#8230; but I still love the experience of being in a bookshop  &#8230;</p>"
56;"<p>Examiner: Statistics show that visits to the cinema are up despite the availability of DVDs and online downloads. Why do you think this might be?<br /> Jamie: I think it&#8217;s the whole experience that the cinema offers &#8230; going out <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to see a film</strong></span> when it <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>goes on general release</strong></span> &#8230; and seeing it <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>on the big screen</strong></span> is more exciting than <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">watching the film</span></strong> at home on TV &#8230; especially if it&#8217;s <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">an action movie</span></strong> &#8230; and watching it with others makes it even more special &#8230;</p>"
57;"<p>Examiner: Have you got a relation you’re particularly fond of?<br /> Sinita: Yes &#8230; my granddad &#8230; he’s 94 years old but generally he’s <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>as fit as a fiddle</strong></span> &#8230; we’re very close and see each other a lot &#8230; whenever he <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">goes down with a cold</span></strong> or <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>is under the weather</strong></span> I make a point of visiting him &#8230;</p>"
58;"<p>Examiner: Do you do any sport?<br /> Jon: Yes &#8230; I’m keen on skateboarding &#8230; but I haven&#8217;t done it for a while &#8230; I had a bad fall recently and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">pulled a muscle</span></strong> and had a few <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">cuts and bruises</span></strong> &#8230; but I’m <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">on the mend</span></strong> and hope to be doing it again soon &#8230;</p>"
59;"<p>Examiner: Is there anything you’re particularly afraid of?<br /> Davide: The dentist &#8230; I hate going to the dentist &#8230; I only ever go if I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">have a toothache</span></strong> so it usually means I have to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">have a filling</span></strong> or even <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">have a tooth out</span></strong> &#8230; I really don’t like it &#8230;</p>"
60;"<p>Pierre:  This is a tricky one really as I’m usually quite healthy &#8230; I’ve never been seriously ill &#8230; like everyone else I sometimes get a few <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">aches and pains</span></strong> or <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">catch a cold</span></strong> &#8230; I can remember a few months ago I had to have time off work with <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a heavy cold</span></strong> &#8230; I had the usual symptoms &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a blocked nose</span></strong> &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sore throat</strong></span> &#8230; it lasted quite a while &#8230; about 2 weeks I think though I didn’t have that much time off work &#8230; for a few days I remember <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">feeling poorly</span></strong> but I was <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">over the worst of it</span></strong> after a few days and went back to work &#8230; I always find it’s better to be active when you feel ill as it keeps your mind of your symptoms &#8230; I think my family get a little fed up with me when I’m ill though &#8230; I tend to feel sorry for myself and lie on the sofa all day as if I’<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">m at death’s door</span></strong> &#8230; but as I said earlier &#8230; on this occasion it was nothing serious and didn&#8217;t really cause me any problems &#8230;</p>"
61;"<p>Examiner: What costs are involved when you are ill in your country?<br /> Anya: Well &#8230; people have to pay <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">prescription charges</span></strong> which can be quite expensive &#8230; but fortunately general healthcare is free &#8230; unless you want to <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>go private</strong></span> of course and then  you can pay a fortune for your treatment &#8230;</p>"
62;"<p>Examiner: In your experience are people too quick to take time off work when they’re ill?<br /> Alicia: Yes .. I’ve got friends who have a day off work if they wake up with a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">runny nose</span></strong> &#8230; and in most cases they seem <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to make a speedy recovery</span> </strong>after they’ve <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">phoned in sick</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
63;"<p>Examiner: Do women pay more attention to their health than men?<br /> Julie: I think so yes &#8230; women are more likely to see their <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">GP</span></strong> for a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">check-up</span></strong> if they&#8217;re concerned about something &#8230; men tend to avoid facing up to any health problems they have &#8230; my dad always seems to have a very <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>chesty cough</strong></span> but refuses to go to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">make an appointment</span> </strong>to see the doctor &#8230;</p>"
64;"<p>Examiner: What do you do?<br /> Sasha: I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>do a job-share</strong></span> with a friend in a boutique &#8230; I enjoy it &#8230; I like working with customers &#8230; unfortunately it&#8217;s only <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">temporary work</span></strong> but <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">one of the perks of the job</span></strong> is I get a discount on the clothes &#8230;</p>"
65;"<p>Examiner: Do you have any career plans yet?<br /> Carly: Yes &#8230; I&#8217;d like to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">be my own boss</span></strong> one day &#8230; I&#8217;m interested in programming and I&#8217;d like to create apps for myself or for other companies &#8230; I know being <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>self employed</strong></span> would be a challenge but the idea of doing a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">nine-to-five job</span></strong> doesn&#8217;t appeal to me at all &#8230;</p>"
66;"<p>Examiner: What do you see yourself doing in 10 years time?<br /> Marie: I&#8217;d hope to be working &#8230; not <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a high-powered job</span></strong> &#8230; but I&#8217;m quite a creative person so something where I can <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">work with my hands</span></strong> would be nice &#8230; as long as I&#8217;m not <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">stuck behind a desk </span></strong>doing something boring<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span> <span style=""color: #000000;"">in a dead-end job</span></strong> I&#8217;ll be happy &#8230;</p>"
67;"<p>Max:  I&#8217;ve always loved watching wildlife programmes on TV and often thought how much I&#8217;d enjoy working with animals &#8230; perhaps in a safari park &#8230; something like that &#8230; you&#8217;d probably need a degree to have any chance of being <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">called for an interview</span></strong> and whether there are many <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">full-time jobs</span></strong> I don&#8217;t know &#8230; I&#8217;m sure a lot of parks rely on <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">voluntary work</span></strong> so it might not be easy &#8230; and it probably wouldn&#8217;t be <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">well-paid</span></strong> either but money isn&#8217;t everything &#8230; I&#8217;d get so much<strong> job satisfaction</strong> &#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine it being the kind of job where you get <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">stuck in a rut</span></strong> &#8230; and I think I&#8217;d be good at it as well &#8230; I&#8217;d love to work with animals I enjoy <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">manual work</span></strong> and I&#8217;m <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a good team player</span></strong> &#8230; so even though the <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">working conditions</span></strong> might not be the best I think that would be my ideal job &#8230;</p>"
68;"<p>Examiner: If there are a limited number of jobs available who should be given priority, young people or older people with more experience?<br /> Anna: Things are so different these days &#8230; a few years ago older employees would often <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">take early retirement</span></strong> or go onto <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">part-time </span></strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">contracts</span> and there were always opportunities for younger people but now jobs are so scarce &#8230; I think younger people need to be given the chance whenever possible &#8230;</p>"
69;"<p>Examiner: What are some of the important things a candidate should find out before accepting a job?<br /> Ali: Well  &#8230; you&#8217;d need to know about your area of responsibility &#8230; and your salary of course and then there are things like <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">holiday entitlement</span></strong> &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>maternity or paternity leave</strong></span> &#8230; if you&#8217;re thinking of having children &#8230; and what the situation is regarding <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sick leave</strong></span> &#8230; that kind of thing &#8230;</p>"
70;"<p>Examiner: What are the advantages of having your own business rather than working for someone else?<br /> Julie: Well &#8230; unfortunately being an employee at the moment is very stressful &#8230; people have very <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">heavy workloads</span></strong> &#8230; they&#8217;re always under pressure to <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">meet deadlines</span></strong> &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>running your own business</strong></span> isn&#8217;t easy &#8230; but I do think it would be far more satisfying &#8230;</p>"
71;"<p>Examiner: Are you studying English at a school?<br /> Michel: Yes &#8230; I&#8217;m taking <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>an intensive course</strong></span> at a local <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>private language school</strong></span> &#8230; I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>attend classes</strong></span> three times a week &#8230;</p>"
73;"<p>Examiner: When you were younger did you enjoy your time at school?</p> <p>Theo: Yes &#8230; I liked school &#8230; it was an ordinary <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>state school</strong></span> &#8230; nothing special &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a single-sex school</strong> </span>&#8230; which I&#8217;m not sure I liked &#8230; but the teachers were great &#8230; I had lots of friends and I never <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>played truant</strong></span> like some pupils there &#8230;</p>"
74;"<p>Caroline:  I&#8217;d like to tell you about my time at university &#8230; I was <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a mature student</strong> </span>&#8230; I didn&#8217;t go to university until I was 25 &#8230; and it was my first time away from my parents so it was very exciting &#8230; I was doing <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a Bachelors Degree</strong></span> and it was a bit of a challenge &#8230; some people <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>take a year out</strong> </span>but I&#8217;d been away from education for 8 years &#8230; plus I had <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to work my way through uni</strong> </span>so I was very busy &#8230; and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sitting exams</strong></span> at the end of each year was a new experience for me as well but I really enjoyed <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>higher education</strong></span>  learning about a subject I loved &#8230; history &#8230; and the social life was great as well &#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had so many friends &#8230; I had my <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>graduation ceremony</strong></span> last year in the local cathedral and I know my parents were really proud &#8230; so yes &#8230; that was a really happy time &#8230; I&#8217;m thinking of doing a <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Masters Degree</strong></span> soon &#8230; though that might be through <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>distance learning</strong> </span>as I have a full-time job now &#8230;</p>"
75;"<p>Examiner: What qualities do you think a good teacher has?<br /> Anna: They should be patient &#8230; they should be <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>subject specialists</strong></span> and be able to explain the subject clearly &#8230; they should <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>give feedback</strong></span> quickly &#8230; for example not hang on to essay for ages like some of my teachers &#8230;</p>"
76;"<p>Examiner: What are the advantages of studying on a distance learning course?<br /> Florrie: It&#8217;s a more flexible way of studying especially if you have a job &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>tuition fees</strong></span> are usually cheaper &#8230; but you have to be very motivated &#8230; and I would imagine more people <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>fall behind with their studies</strong></span> compared to  <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>face-to-face classes</strong></span> &#8230;</p>"
77;"<p>Examiner: Do all children get equal opportunities in education?<br /> Julie: In my country I think it is quite equal but in the UK I&#8217;ve heard that most people who go to the top universities have studied at <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>public schools</strong></span> &#8230; you have to be very rich to study in a school like that  &#8230; they&#8217;re usually <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>boarding schools</strong></span> as well so the fees are enormous &#8230;</p>"
78;"<p>Examiner: Do you like to cook?<br /> Mandy: Not really no  &#8230; most of the time I eat <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>ready meals</strong></span> and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>take-aways</strong></span> &#8230; that&#8217;s one of the reasons I love visiting my mum &#8230; you can always guarantee lovely <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>home-cooked food</strong></span> &#8230;</p>"
79;"<p>Examiner: What time do you usually eat dinner?<br /> Michelle: We have our <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>main meal</strong></span> at around 7.00 &#8230; I&#8217;m usually <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">starving hungry</span></strong> by then &#8230; in fact I often <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">grab a bite to eat</span> </strong>as soon as I get home from college &#8230; a sandwich perhaps &#8230; but not too much <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">to spoil my appetite</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
80;"<p>Examiner: Are there any types of food you don&#8217;t like?<br /> Lionel: No not really &#8230; I&#8217;m not <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a fussy eater</strong></span> at all &#8230; actually I <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">eat like a horse</span></strong> &#8230; I do a lot of sport and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">work up quite an appetite</span></strong> &#8230;</p>"
81;"<p>Howard:  OK &#8230; this is a nice topic to talk about &#8230; there&#8217;s a restaurant just around the corner from where I live &#8230; it&#8217;s an Italian restaurant so as you&#8217;d expect you can eat various pasta dishes and pizzas and I usually go there with my family for <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a slap-up meal</span></strong> if we have anything to celebrate &#8230; it&#8217;s quite a posh restaurant &#8230; the kind of place you would take someone if you wanted <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to wine and dine</strong></span> them &#8230; we usually order <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a 3-course meal</span></strong> &#8230; a light starter then a main dish &#8230; and I have quite <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a sweet tooth</span></strong> so I always look forward to the dessert &#8230; I usually order Tiramisu &#8230; it <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">makes my mouth water</span></strong> just to think about it &#8230; I&#8217;m always totally <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">full up</span></strong> by the end &#8230; why do I enjoy it there &#8230; well &#8230; it&#8217;s not cheap &#8230; my parents always <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>foot the bill</strong></span> and we couldn&#8217;t afford to go there regularly so it&#8217;s always a nice treat  &#8230;</p>"
82;"<p>Examiner: How can we encourage people to eat more healthily?<br /> Anna: I think the best approach is to have everything in moderation &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">processed food</span></strong> won&#8217;t kill you if you only eat it occasionally &#8230; but people should also be encouraged <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to eat a balanced diet</strong></span> &#8230; try to cook fresh ingredients at home a few times a week &#8230;</p>"
83;"<p>Examiner: Do you think people enjoy their food as much as they should?<br /> Florrie: I don&#8217;t know really &#8230; I suppose it&#8217;s true that people will often eat <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">a quick snack</span></strong> because they&#8217;re bored not because they&#8217;re <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>dying of hunger</strong></span> &#8230; and often they just <strong>bolt it down</strong> and don&#8217;t savour it &#8230; so yes &#8230; perhaps we could take more time over our food &#8230;</p>"
84;"<p>Examiner: Do you think cooking is a pleasure or a chore for people who have busy lives?<br /> Julie: Well &#8230; whether you <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">follow a recipe</span></strong> of make something up as you go along &#8230; I think cooking is a very creative process &#8230; and cooking for other people is a particular pleasure &#8230; there&#8217;s nothing more satisfying than seeing people you love <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>tucking into</strong></span> something you&#8217;ve cooked yourself &#8230;</p>"
85;"<p>Examiner: Do you do any sports?<br /> Loiuse: Not really &#8230; no &#8230; I always say I&#8217;m going <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to take up exercise</strong></span> and try <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to get into shape</strong></span> but I never seem to get started &#8230; I sometimes wonder whether  I should get <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a personal trainer</strong></span> &#8230; someone who will sort out <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a fitness programme</strong></span> for me and make me <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>train hard</strong></span> &#8230;.</p>"
86;"<p>Examiner: How do you spend a typical weekend?<br /> Stella: I&#8217;m a big <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>football fan</strong></span> and weekends always centre around <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a football match</strong></span> &#8230; I support FC Utrecht and have <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a season ticket</strong></span> so I go to most of the <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>home games</strong></span> and quite a few of the <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>away games</strong></span> too  &#8230; I&#8217;m really looking forward to the new <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>football season</strong></span> starting soon &#8230;</p>"
87;"<p>Examiner: Have you got any hobbies or interests?</p> <p>Theo: Yes &#8230; I&#8217;m really keen on sports &#8230; I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>do judo</strong> </span>once a week and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>play tennis</strong></span> in the summer &#8230; I think it&#8217;s really important <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to keep fit</strong></span> &#8230; it makes you feel good and energised for work and your studies &#8230;.</p>"
88;"<p>Maurice:  I&#8217;d like to talk about my local <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sports centre</strong></span> &#8230; it&#8217;s a place I spend a lot of time in  &#8230; it&#8217;s a new building with all the latest <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>sports facilities</strong> </span>&#8230; I probably go there at least twice a week &#8230; sometimes more often &#8230; it&#8217;s a huge place &#8230; there&#8217;s an outdoor <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>athletics track</strong> </span>and some <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>football pitches</strong></span> &#8230; I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>play football</strong></span> so I&#8217;m often out there &#8230; there are several indoor <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>squash and tennis courts</strong></span> that I use occasionally &#8230; a big <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>swimming pool</strong> </span>&#8230; although I don&#8217;t use that very often &#8230; I&#8217;m not a very <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>strong swimmer</strong></span> &#8230; there&#8217;s a gym &#8230; lots of things really &#8230; why do I enjoy going there &#8230; it&#8217;s just a really fun place to be &#8230; there&#8217;s a good social side to it all &#8230; you can enter competitions &#8230; meet up with other people who want to do the same sports &#8230; and because there are so many activities on offer it gets you interested in different things &#8230; for example I was listening to some people talking about training <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to run the marathon</strong></span> and I&#8217;ve decided I might even think about that &#8230; I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>go jogging</strong></span> a couple of times a week so it would give me something to aim for &#8230; so yes &#8230; the sports centre &#8230; that&#8217;s the place I really like to visit &#8230;</p>"
89;"<p>Examiner: Should people be encouraged more to take up sport?<br /> Alejandro: I think young people should be given the chance to discover which sport they might like &#8230; watching sport is sometimes a good way to get people started &#8230; not on TV but actually getting out &#8230; take athletics for example &#8230; they could go to <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>an athletics meeting</strong></span> &#8230; there are so many different sports on show one might interest them &#8230;</p>"
90;"<p>Examiner: Why do some people enjoy participating in sport more than others?<br /> Florrie: That&#8217;s a good question &#8230; I suppose some people are more concerned about their health &#8230; they can&#8217;t stand the thought of <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>being out of condition</strong></span> &#8230; other people might be driven to excel &#8230; they want <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to set records</strong></span> or get <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>personal bests</strong></span> &#8230;</p>"
91;"<p>Examiner: Which sports do you think are best for people who aren&#8217;t used to physical activity?<br /> Julie: Well &#8230; I think people like this should avoid <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>strenuous exercise</strong></span> so things like <strong>circuit training</strong> are definitely out of the question &#8230; maybe just doing <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a brisk walk</strong></span> every day &#8230; or swimming is always a good way to get started &#8230;</p>"
92;"<p>Examiner: Do you enjoy using technology?<br /> Stephan: Well &#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t call myself <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>a techie</strong></span> or a <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>computer buff</strong></span> but I enjoy using computers &#8230; I&#8217;d like to find out more about  how they work &#8230; when my <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>computer crashes</strong></span> I never know what to do.</p>"
93;"<p>Examiner: Do you use the Internet for your studies?<br /> Sophie: Yes &#8230; I&#8217;d be lost without it &#8230; I do lots of <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">video conferencing</span></strong> to practise speaking and <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>social media</strong></span> like Facebook is a good way to meet up with other students &#8230; and I <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>download podcasts</strong></span> that teach English vocabulary and grammar.</p>"
94;"<p>Examiner: Do you have your own computer?<br /> Tania: Yes &#8230; I have a Macbook Pro &#8230; I use it all the time &#8230; for <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>word processing</strong></span> &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>browsing websites</strong></span> and catching up with TV programmes I&#8217;ve missed.</p>"
95;"<p>Mattie: I don&#8217;t have many <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>gadgets</strong></span> &#8230; just a computer &#8230; a laptop and my mobile phone &#8230; but I&#8217;ll talk about my computer as it&#8217;s so useful &#8230; it&#8217;s funny really &#8230; 2 years ago I was still learning to use computers &#8230; how to use email &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">send attachments</span></strong> how to <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>access websites</strong></span> &#8230; then I decided to do a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">digital editing</span></strong> course for video and photography &#8230; and so I bought the laptop when I started the course  &#8230;  my husband had a <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>desktop PC</strong></span> but it was very slow so I decided <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to upgrade</strong></span> to a powerful one because we do a lot of video editing on the course &#8230; it&#8217;s a <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">high-spec</span></strong> laptop &#8230; very fast &#8230; the latest <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>operating system</strong></span> &#8230; it <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">boots up</span></strong> really quickly and it&#8217;s  fun to use so it makes working a pleasure &#8230; I&#8217;ve become a competent computer user now &#8230; if I didn&#8217;t have it I daresay I&#8217;d have to spend more time at college using their computers &#8230; but on the positive side I suppose I&#8217;d read a lot more if I didn&#8217;t have it  &#8230;  I probably waste a lot of time <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>surfing the web</strong></span> &#8230; but hopefully I won&#8217;t have to be without it &#8230;</p>"
96;"<p>Examiner: What do you think are the important things people need to learn when they start using computers?<br /> Alejandro: Well &#8230; there are things like how to use the Internet  &#8230; how<strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> to enter a web address</span></strong> &#8230; how <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to navigate websites</strong> </span>&#8230; that kind of thing but it&#8217;s also important to know how <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to back up</strong></span> your files in case your computer crashes &#8230; and all about <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Internet security</span></strong>.</p>"
97;"<p>Examiner: What kind of technological developments have made the biggest impact on our lives?<br /> Faydene: In my lifetime it has to be the Internet of course but I also think wifi has made a huge difference to how we interact with the Internet &#8230; <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">wireless networks</span></strong> at home and public <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">wifi hotspots</span></strong> mean we can <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>go online</strong></span> easily &#8230; <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>access our mail</strong></span> &#8230; log into our work intranet and basically be connected wherever we are.</p>"
98;"<p>Examiner: Do computers make it much easier to study?<br /> Jane: Definitely yes &#8230; researching information is much easier with the Internet .. you can <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">bookmark webpages</span></strong> for future reference and writing essays is much easier &#8230; being able <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to cut and paste</strong></span> sections of text means you can experiment with organisation &#8230; so yes &#8230; compared to years ago when you had a pile of books on your desk and a pen and paper &#8230; it&#8217;s now much easier.</p>"
99;"<p>Examiner: Do you see your friends very often?<br /> Louisa: Yes &#8230; we meet up most weekends &#8230; we all <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>get on really well</strong></span> and <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">have a lot in common</span></strong> so we&#8217;re always happy doing the same things and going to the same places.</p>"

Cristine: Yes &hellip; it certainly is in my country &hellip; I think the problem for some people is a lack of commitment &hellip; all relationships  strong>have their ups and downs</strong>  &hellip;. but some people prefer to <strong>break up</strong></span> rather than <strong>working at the relationship</strong>.</p>

104;"<p>Examiner: What do you think is the ideal time to get married?<br /> Terry: Personally &#8230; I think you should wait until you&#8217;ve found yourself first &#8230; decided if you want a career &#8230; perhaps do some travelling &#8230; you should do this before <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>tying the knot</strong></span> &#8230; although if you <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>fall head over heels in love</strong></span> plans like these can easily be forgotten.</p>"
105;"<p>Examiner: Is it important to keep in contact with our friends when we&#8217;re in a relationship?<br /> Maria: Absolutely &#8230; it&#8217;s so easy to <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>drift apart</strong> </span>from your friends when you <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>fall in love</strong></span> &#8230; but I think both partners should try not <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to lose touch with</strong></span> their friends  &#8230; that&#8217;s the best way to have a <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>healthy relationship</strong></span> with your partner.</p>"
